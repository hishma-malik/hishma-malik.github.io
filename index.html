            <p class="small-text">
            Welcome to my online portfolio! This website showcases my projects and writings. If you are seeing this, its definitely still in the build process (lol) and will be complete soon! My interests have always lied in the genuine understanding and appreciation of the world and universe we live in. Early on, that translated into mathematical lens for me and led me to my academic journey in Applied Math. While my core interests still like in the field of both Pure and Applied Math, Machine Learning emerged as a direct and organic progression of the theorietical classes I took during my undergrad. I now work as a Data Scientist but more importantly, I am interested in understanding and developing the mathematical foundations of machine intelligence. More can be found on my research interests in the Blog tab. Welcome, take a look around and feel free to get in touch!
